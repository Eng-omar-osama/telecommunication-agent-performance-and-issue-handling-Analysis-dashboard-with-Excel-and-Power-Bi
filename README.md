This report analyzes agents' Average Handling Time (AHT), measuring both the overall AHT in minutes and total AHT in hours.
It helps assess agent efficiency by identifying those with longer handling times, which may indicate areas for process improvement

CSAT Average is a simple average and doesn‚Äôt account for call volume, making it less fair.
Weighted CSAT Average considers the number of calls, giving a more accurate and balanced evaluation.

This tracks agents' improvement over time.
A decrease in AHT suggests better efficiency and faster issue resolution, while an increase may indicate challenges or more complex cases.

This report tracks agents' AHT trends over three months.
AHT fluctuations indicate efficiency changes‚Äîdecreasing AHT suggests improved handling time, while increases may highlight operational challenges.

The scoring system assigns 9 points per call, measuring each agent‚Äôs performance based on:

‚úÖ Their improvement over their own average ‚úÖ Their performance vs. overall average ‚úÖ Their performance vs. issue-specific average

This ensures accurate tracking of agent progress.

This report tracks issue resolution efficiency:

üìå Total Cases: 12,954 üìå Solved Cases: 9,491 (73.27% solved)

üîπ Top Solved Issues (100%): Codes 10, 11, 12 üîπ Lowest Solved Rate (32.2%): Code 2

It highlights areas needing improvement and issue resolution trends.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Issue Code 1 has the highest total AHT (3870.10 hrs) due to its high case volume (5507 cases), not per-case complexity.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Issue Code 8 has the highest Avg AHT (98.67 min), making it the most time-intensive per case.

3Ô∏è‚É£ High total AHT comes from either high case volume or long resolution time per case. Optimizing both is key to efficiency.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Issue Code 1 has the highest weighted CSAT (23.21), likely due to its high case volume.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Issue Codes 10 & 11 have the highest average CSAT (5.00), but their impact is low due to fewer cases.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Balancing high case volume with quality service is essential to maintain customer satisfaction.

Total AHT is decreasing, suggesting improved efficiency.
Issue Code 1 has the highest AHT, making it the biggest contributor.
Optimizing its resolution could significantly reduce total AHT.
Some issues take longer to resolve, indicating complexity or inefficiencies.

The descriptive analysis for the three months shows that AHT peaked in February before improving in March.
Issue Code 8 had the highest resolution time, especially in February.
Some issues, like Codes 10, 11, and 12, appeared only in certain months, indicating possible seasonal trends or resolution over time.
Addressing inefficiencies in high AHT issues can improve performance.

This project was developed using Excel and Power BI, leveraging their capabilities for data processing and visualization.
However, the same analysis can be conducted using other tools depending on project needs.
The dashboard is dynamic, meaning any updates to the main data file will automatically reflect in the visualizations, ensuring real-time insights.
This flexibility makes it a scalable and adaptable solution for ongoing analysis and decision-making.
